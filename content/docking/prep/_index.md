Before performing molecular docking simulations, it is crucial to properly prepare both the protein target and the ligands of interest.
This preparation step ensures that the molecules are in a suitable format and have the necessary characteristics for accurate and reliable docking results.
By carefully preparing the protein and ligands, researchers can enhance the quality and reproducibility of their docking experiments, ultimately leading to more meaningful insights into the binding interactions between these molecules.
