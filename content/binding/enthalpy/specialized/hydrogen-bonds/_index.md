Categorizing and defining hydrogen bonds as a non-covalent interaction has been rife with controversy.
IUPAC currently defines a hydrogen bond as [^arunan2011definition]

> The hydrogen bond is an attractive interaction between a hydrogen atom from a molecule or a molecular fragment X&mdash;H in which X is more electronegative than H, and an atom or a group of atoms in the same or a different molecule, in which there is evidence of bond formation.

> A typical hydrogen bond may be depicted as X&mdash;H⋅⋅⋅Y&mdash;Z, where the three dots denote the bond.
> X&mdash;H represents the hydrogen bond donor.
> The acceptor may be an atom or an anion Y, or a fragment or a molecule Y&mdash;Z, where Y is bonded to Z.
> In some cases, X and Y are the same.
> In more specific cases, X and Y are the same and X&mdash;H and Y&mdash;H distances are the same as well leading to symmetric hydrogen bonds.
> In any event, the acceptor is an electron rich region such as, but not limited to, a lone pair of Y or π-bonded pair of Y&mdash;Z.

IUPAC provides criteria as evidence or characteristics of a hydrogen bond.

> The evidence for hydrogen bond formation may be experimental or theoretical, or ideally, a combination of both.
> Some criteria useful as evidence and some typical characteristics for hydrogen bonding, not necessarily exclusive, are listed below, numbered E---
title: and C#, respectively.
> The greater the number of criteria satisfied, the more reliable is the characterization as a hydrogen bond.
>
> **(E1).** The forces involved in the formation of a hydrogen bond include those of an electrostatic origin, those arising from charge transfer between the donor and acceptor leading to partial covalent bond formation between H and Y, and those originating from dispersion.<br>
> **(E2).** The atoms X and H are covalently bonded to one another and the X&mdash;H bond is polarized, the H⋅⋅⋅Y bond strength increasing with the increase in electronegativity of X.<br>
> **(E3).** The X&mdash;H⋅⋅⋅Y angle is usually linear (180º) and the closer the angle is to 180º, the stronger is the hydrogen bond and the shorter is the H⋅⋅⋅Y distance.<br>
> **(E4).** The length of the X&mdash;H bond usually increases on hydrogen bond formation leading to a red shift in the infrared X&mdash;H stretching frequency and an increase in the infrared absorption cross-section for the X&mdash;H stretching vibration. The greater the lengthening of the X&mdash;H bond in X&mdash;H⋅⋅⋅Y, the stronger is the H⋅⋅⋅Y bond. Simultaneously, new vibrational modes associated with the formation of the H⋅⋅⋅Y bond are generated.<br>
> **(E5).** The X&mdash;H⋅⋅⋅Y&mdash;Z hydrogen bond leads to characteristic NMR signatures that typically include pronounced proton deshielding for H in X&mdash;H, through hydrogen bond spin&mdash;spin couplings between X and Y, and nuclear Overhauser enhancements.<br>
> **(E6).** The Gibbs energy of formation for the hydrogen bond should be greater than the thermal energy of the system for the hydrogen bond to be detected experimentally.
>
> **(C1).** The pKa of X&mdash;H and pKb of Y&mdash;Z in a given solvent correlate strongly with the energy of the hydrogen bond formed between them.<br>
> **(C2).** Hydrogen bonds are involved in proton-transfer reactions (X&mdash;H⋅⋅⋅Y → X⋅⋅⋅H&mdash;Y) and may be considered the partially activated precursors to such reactions.<br>
> **(C3).** Networks of hydrogen bonds can show the phenomenon of co-operativity, leading to deviations from pair-wise additivity in hydrogen bond properties.<br>
> **(C4).** Hydrogen bonds show directional preferences and influence packing modes in crystal structures.<br>
> **(C5).** Estimates of charge transfer in hydrogen bonds show that the interaction energy correlates well with the extent of charge transfer between the donor and the acceptor.<br>
> **(C6).** Analysis of the electron density topology of hydrogen-bonded systems usually shows a bond path connecting H and Y and a (3,&mdash;1) bond critical point between H and Y.
