Covalent interactions are the chemical bonds formed by the sharing of electrons between atoms.
These strong interactions play a crucial role in determining the structure, stability, and reactivity of molecules.
In the context of drug design, covalent interactions are essential for understanding the binding of drugs to their targets.
Covalent drugs, which form irreversible bonds with their targets, have unique advantages and disadvantages compared to non-covalent drugs.
By exploring the nature of covalent interactions and their role in drug-target binding, we can design more effective and specific therapeutic agents.
