TODO:

One common method for assigning partial charges is the Restrained ElectroStatic Potential (RESP) fitting scheme, which adds a penalty term to prevent unrealistically large charges on buried atoms.
This approach has been used in popular force fields such as AMBER.
Other constraints, such as equalizing charges on equivalent atoms or ensuring charge neutrality within subgroups, are also often imposed during the fitting process.

It is important to note that partial charges obtained from ESP fitting do not include the effects of polarization, which is the redistribution of electron density in response to an external electric field.
Polarization is a many-body effect that arises from the interaction between two or more molecules and can significantly contribute to the overall electrostatic energy.
Neglecting polarization can lead to a systematic underestimation of the electrostatic energy.

To account for polarization effects, polarizable force fields have been developed, which include additional terms to describe the induced dipole moments of atoms in response to the electric field generated by the surrounding atoms.
These force fields provide a more accurate description of electrostatic interactions, particularly in systems with significant polarization effects, such as proteins and polar solvents.

The accuracy of electrostatic interactions in molecular simulations depends on several factors, including the quality of the partial charges, the treatment of polarization effects, and the choice of dielectric constant.
In practice, the dielectric constant is often used as a scaling factor to implicitly account for the screening of electrostatic interactions by the surrounding environment, such as solvent molecules.
