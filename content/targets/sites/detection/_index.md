Pocket discovery, also known as pocket detection or cavity detection, is a computational approach that aims to locate and analyze potential binding sites on proteins.
This process involves the use of various algorithms and tools that can efficiently explore the protein surface and identify regions with favorable physicochemical properties for ligand binding.
These properties may include the size and shape of the pocket, the presence of specific amino acid residues, and the electrostatic potential of the surrounding environment.

The importance of pocket discovery lies in its ability to narrow down the search space for potential drug binding sites, thereby facilitating the subsequent steps of virtual screening and molecular docking.
By focusing on specific regions of the protein that are more likely to accommodate ligands, researchers can save time and computational resources, while increasing the chances of finding promising drug candidates.

Moreover, pocket discovery can provide valuable insights into the structure-function relationships of proteins.
By identifying and comparing the binding sites across different proteins, researchers can gain a better understanding of the evolutionary conservation and divergence of these regions, as well as their role in protein-ligand interactions and biological processes.

In the following section, we will explore some of the specific tools and methods commonly used for pocket detection.
These tools employ various algorithms and scoring functions to assess the druggability and accessibility of potential binding sites, providing researchers with a powerful toolkit for advancing the drug discovery process.
