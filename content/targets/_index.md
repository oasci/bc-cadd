Biological targets serve as crucial control points at the molecular level.
These targets, predominantly proteins like enzymes and receptors, serve as recognition sites for other molecules.
This binding event can initiate a domino effect within the cell, influencing fundamental processes like metabolism and intercellular communication.
Pharmaceutical research strategically leverages this intricate dance by designing drugs to target these specific structures.
These drugs can mimic or inhibit the natural processes the target molecule governs.
