## Abstract

> AutoDock Vina is arguably one of the fastest and most widely used open-source programs for molecular docking.
> However, compared to other programs in the AutoDock Suite, it lacks support for modeling specific features such as macrocycles or explicit water molecules.
> Here, we describe the implementation of this functionality in AutoDock Vina 1.2.0.
> Additionally, AutoDock Vina 1.2.0 supports the AutoDock4.2 scoring function, simultaneous docking of multiple ligands, and a batch mode for docking a large number of ligands.
> Furthermore, we implemented Python bindings to facilitate scripting and the development of docking workflows.
> This work is an effort toward the unification of the features of the AutoDock4 and AutoDock Vina programs.
