**Title:** Automated docking of substrates to proteins by simulated annealing

**Authors:** David S. Goodsell, Arthur J. Olson

**Journal:** Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics

**Year:** 1990

**DOI:** [10.1002/prot.340080302](https://doi.org/10.1002/prot.340080302)

## Abstract

> The Metropolis technique of conformation searching is combined with rapid energy evaluation using molecular affinity potentials to give an efficient procedure for docking substrates to macromolecules of known structure.
> The procedure works well on a number of crystallographic test systems, functionally reproducing the observed binding modes of several substrates.
